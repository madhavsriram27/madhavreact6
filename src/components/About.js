      <p>
        Im madhav sriram im pursuing my b-tech in vit. Certainly! As a Full Stack Developer, I am skilled in both front-end and back-end technologies, which allows me to work on all aspects of web application development. I am proficient in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development, and languages such as Python, Java, or PHP for back-end development.

Additionally, I am experienced in using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. On the back-end, I can work with frameworks such as Node.js, Django, or Laravel to handle server-side logic, database management, and API development.

As a Full Stack Developer, I am also familiar with various databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL, and I have knowledge of version control systems like Git. I am passionate about creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications by using a combination of the latest technologies and best development practices.

Whether it's designing the user interface, implementing server-side functionality, or deploying an application to production, I have the skills to handle all stages of the development process.
